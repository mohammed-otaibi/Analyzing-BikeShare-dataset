# Data Analysis: Merging and Exploratory Data Analysis  

## Overview  
This project focuses on merging three different datasets and performing descriptive and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Through this process, valuable insights are extracted to understand patterns and relationships between different variables, aiding in data-driven decision-making.

## Key Components  
- **Data Merging**: Collecting and integrating data from multiple sources into a unified dataset.  
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Providing statistical summaries to understand data distribution and key trends.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Checking for missing values, detecting patterns, and visualizing data interactively.  

## Objectives  
- Provide clear insights into the data.  
- Enhance data quality before modeling.  
- Support data-driven decision-making using descriptive and exploratory analysis.
